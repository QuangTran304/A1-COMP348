## Requirements for Java part:
- Strictly use the classes defined in `Q1.` May not defined additional classes.
- Use try-with-resources to open the file. The input file must be given by the user.
- Strictly use functional programming and Java API for sorting & displaying Employee objects. Use `Arrays.sort()`. No additional classes or interfaces are allowed. The Employee class may not implement the `Comparable` interface.
- Use **Java stream API** to process the input file. You may use `String.split()` to transform the input lines as a line array, and eventually into an array of employees.
- Use **Java Stream API** to display the summary information. No explicit loops may be used.
- Use at least one **method-reference** in your code.
